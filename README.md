# Countdown Clock

This is a simple app built with React via Create React App. Upon loading, the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds until New Year's Day are shown. The user may insert another day. 

The concept of a countdown timer gives me the stressy heebie jeebies. Who wants this pressure? I don't. But I do like making little things to keep me warmed up in React and to play with Sass.
